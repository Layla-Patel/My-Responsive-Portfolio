                I love to swim because it is an excellent way to get excersise and do team-bonding activities. When you 
                swim as a proffesional activity, you must take in the fact that you must stay in shape, drink lots of water, eat 
                healthy, and stretch a lot. It has been my dream to represent my team at the Junior Olympics and at the 
                Nevada State Championships. I have been swimming on a real team since I was five or six years old.
                I started out at Lifetime Fitness for about four years and I just starte.d at BCH about a year and 
                a half ago. I want to continue to swim with my team at BCH because the coaches are very nice and they 
                push me to keep training hard. I began at BCH in the beginner group and now I am in the Pre Junior Olympic
                group. My coach has taught me how to work hard and pursue my dream to get to the Junior Olympics. So I
                will continue to work hard until I reach my goal.

                Since I started out at coding about four and a quarter years ago, I have always been pretty interested in 
                designing websites. I began with my first website about my family my second website was about a company
                of baking and now I am working on my responsive portfolio. Coding has taken my on an inspiring journey 
                that taught me not only to code but also how to figure things out independently. All of the teachers here are 
                the nicest and the most helpful ever. I hope I can continue to stay here and keep working on enhanceing old
                websites and creating new ones.

                Baking has been one of my hobbies forever. My aunt is an excellent baker. She bakes things like 4 - teir
                anneversary  cakes, tye dye rainbow cupcakes, and much much more. S ince covid hit, I beagn baking more creative
                things like rainbow sprinkle bread, football brownies, double chocolate chip cookies and more. I would love to 
                start baking more things like my aunt. So, I will continue to keep baking until I become as good of a baker as my
                aunt.
